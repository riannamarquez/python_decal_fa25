# Questions (Answer these in the homework2.py file as comments):

# 1) What’s the difference between Git, GitHub, and Git Bash?
# Git is the core system that tracks all the files of a project, GitHub is the web-service for sharing & repositories, and GitBash is a terminal to use a Git control system. 

# 2) What’s the difference between the terminal and the command line?
# The terminal is the progrma that allows you to type command lines and see output where the command line is the interface itself where you can type commands.

# 3) How does Windows PowerShell differ from Git Bash?
# Powershell was manufactured to be integrated into windows and is able to run python script while Git Bash cannot.

# 4) What’s the difference between Anaconda, conda, and Python?
# Anaconda is the distribution built around Python for data science, Conda is the tool for managing these packages in Anaconda, and Python is the language itself.

# 5) What is VS Code? 
# VS Code is a software to edit script.

# 6) What is a Jupyter Notebook? How is it different from Jupyter Lab?
# Jupyter notebook is an application for creating and sharing documents for live code and Jupyter lab is a more comprehensive software as a file browser for Jupyter notebooks and other interactive elements.

# 7) What does ~/ mean?
# ~/ brings the user to a home directory.

# 8) What’s the difference between an absolute path and a relative path?
# Absolute path shows the directory for the root of the file system while the relative path shows the directory in relation to the current working directory.

# 9) Imagine you're in your "yourname" repo. Write the absolute and relative paths to "course_assignments/homework2".
# Absolute: c/Users/seeyo/OneDrive/Desktop/python_decal_fa25/Rianna Relative: python_decal_fa25/Rianna

# 10) What command lets you move from "course_assignments/homework2/" to "course_assignments/"?
# cd ..

# 11) What would rm ./ do in your current directory? (Don’t try it!)
# It would remove the file you're working in in your current directory.

# 12) What do the following commands do?
# git add
# git commit
# git push
# git add brings the working directory to the staging area, git commit records changes into the local repository, and git push transfers the changes from the local to remote repository.

# 13) What's the difference between "git add ." and "git add <file>"?
# git add stages all the new and modified files while gid add <file> stages a specified file.

# 14) What do "git status" and "git log -1" do?
# git status displays the current state of the working directory and the staging area and git log -1 displays the commit history of the repository.

# 15) What’s the difference between cloning a repository and pulling from it?
# Cloning a repository downloads an entire repository to the local system while pulling updates the existing local repository.

# 16) What has been your most frustrating bug or error in this class so far? How did you troubleshoot or fix it?
# The VS Code terminal never works; I worked with Katie to integrate GitBash into Powershell to effecitvely run script.

# 17) What’s a question you still have? What’s something you’re confused about?
# I need to clarify the different git commit commands and what they each do.

# 18) Tell me a fun fact!
# Turtles breathe through their butts.

# 19) Print your favorite math expression you've learned in Python so far. 
# (Hint: Use print() and add a comment explaining what it does.)
print(26 % 3) # I love how the modulus shows the remainder of a function.
